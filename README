NAME
    Lingua::Stem::It - Porter's stemming algorithm for Italian

SYNOPSIS
        use Lingua::Stem::It;
        my $stems = Lingua::Stem::It::stem({ -words => $word_list_reference,
                                             -locale => 'it',
                                             -exceptions => $exceptions_hash,
                                          });
    
        my $stem = Lingua::Stem::It::stem_word( $word );                                      

DESCRIPTION
    This module applies the Porter Stemming Algorithm to its parameters,
    returning the stemmed words.

    The algorithm is implemented exactly (I hope :-) as described in:

        http://snowball.tartarus.org/italian/stemmer.html

    The code is carefully crafted to work in conjunction with the the
    Lingua::Stem module by Benjamin Franz, from which I've also
    borrowed some functionalities (caching and exception list).
